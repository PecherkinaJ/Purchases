# Purchases
This project allows you to enter your purchases and do some statistical functions, like sorting by date/good/price, counting total amount for every day, for every month or for each purchase, also counting total amount for given period of time.
In Statistic you can display not tables only, but bright charts too. There is a tab named "Not to forget to buy" for your future purchases.
